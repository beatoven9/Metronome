# Metronome
Modeled after the old Dr. Beat

The metronome plays a constant stream of quarters, eighths, and sixteenths. 

Each note type is handled by a diff function.
    Hopefully this will allow each note value's volume to be adjusted
   
   
Planned is inclusion of eighth note triplets on top of the straight eighths/sixteenths.
